Checkers [1] is a library for reusable QuickCheck properties, particularly
for standard type classes (class laws and class morphisms [2]).  Most of
Reactive [3] can be specified and tested using just these properties.
Also lots of support for randomly generating data values (thanks to Thomas
Davie).

Please share any comments & suggestions on the discussion (talk) page at
[1].

You can configure, build, and install all in the usual way with Cabal
commands.

  runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
  runhaskell Setup.lhs build
  runhaskell Setup.lhs install
